        Recursively nestable clock class. Clocks can fork child-clocks, which can in turn fork their own child-clock.
        Only the master clock calls sleep; child-clocks instead register WakeUpCalls with their parents, who
        register wake-up calls with their parents all the way up to the master clock.
        :param name (optional): can be useful for keeping track in confusing multi-threaded situations
        :param parent: the parent clock for this clock; a value of None indicates the master clock
        :param pool_size: the size of the process pool for unsynchronized forks, which are used for playing notes. Only
        has an effect if this is the master clock.
        :param timing_policy: either "relative", "absolute", or a float between 0 and 1 representing a balance between
        the two. "relative" attempts to keeps each wait call as faithful as possible to what it should be. This can
        result in the clock getting behind real time, since if heavy processing causes us to get behind on one note
        we never catch up. "absolute" tries instead to stay faithful to the time since the clock began. If one wait
        is too long due to heavy processing, later delays will be shorter to try to catch up. This can result in
        inaccuracies in relative timing. Setting the timing policy to a float between 0 and 1 implements a hybrid
        approach in which, when the clock gets behind, it is allowed to catch up somewhat, but only to a certain extent.
        (0 is equivalent to absolute timing, 1 is equivalent to relative timing.)
        :param synchronization_policy: either None or one of "all relatives", "all descendants", "no synchronization",
        or "inherit". Since a clock is woken up by its parent clock, it will always remain synchronized with
        all parents / grandparents / etc; however, if you ask one of its children what time / beat it is on, it may
        have old information, since it has been asleep. If the synchronization_policy is set to "no synchronization",
        then we live with this, but if it is set to "all descendants" then we take the time (and CPU cycles) to catch
        up all its descendants so that they read the correct time. Nevertheless, cousin clocks (other descendants of
        this clock's parent) may still not be caught up, so the "all relatives" policy makes sure that all descendants
        of the master clock - no matter how they are related to this clock - will have up-to-date information about
        what time / beat they are on whenever this clock wakes up. This is the default setting, since it avoids
        inaccurate information, but if there are a lot of clocks it may be valuable to turn off relative synchronization
        if it's slowing things down. The value "inherit" means that this clock inherits its synchronization policy from
        its master. If no value is specified, then it defaults to "all relatives" for the master clock and "inherit"
        for all descendants, which in practice means that all clocks will synchronize with all relatives upon waking.
