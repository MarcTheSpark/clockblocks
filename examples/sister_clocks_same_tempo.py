"""
A simple example in which the master clock forks two parallel (sister) processes and everything moves at the same tempo.
(Although sister 2 prints its beat more frequently than sister 1).

Note that sister1 ends after 5 beats, whereas sister2 ends after 10 beats.

This is similar conceptually to multi-threading, except that the master clock handles all the actual waiting, and
thereby ensures that all its children remain perfectly synchronized.
