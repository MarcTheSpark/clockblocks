"""
Like sister_clocks_same_tempo.py, except that sister 2 is running at a tempo of 180, making it 3 times faster than
sister 1. As a result, it goes through beats more quickly.

Note that sister2 ends when its _time_ reaches 10. This is the same thing as saying when its parent reaches beat 10.
The time of a clock runs the same regardless of its rate, and it represents the inherited rate from its parent, and
from its parent's parent, etc.
